# Sky Atlas v4 — Mock-to-Spec Coverage Matrix

**Version:** v4 (2026-05-11)
**Scope:** Every visual property *named in a committed brainstorm artifact* (`05-archive/brainstorm-mocks/` or `05-archive/design-agents/`). Properties never mentioned in any brainstorm artifact are out of scope — this is a deliberate false-precision guard. The discovery set is 74 rows, seeded from `docs/analyses/2026-05-11-brainstorm-vs-prod-fidelity/phase-1/area-2-spec-capture-audit.md`.

---

## Disposition Legend

| Disposition | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `CAPTURED` | Property is fully spec-contracted; citation to spec file:line provided |
| `DROPPED — UNSTATED` | Property present in brainstorm artifact, absent from all spec files, no documented rationale |
| `DROPPED — DOCUMENTED` | Property present in brainstorm, explicitly rejected or scoped out with rationale in spec |
| `MODIFIED — UNSTATED` | Property present in brainstorm, partially captured in spec, but the delta (what changed) is not documented |
| `MODIFIED — DOCUMENTED` | Property present in brainstorm, captured in modified form, delta explained in spec |
| `DEFERRED-INTENTIONAL` | Property present in brainstorm, carried as an open question (G1–G8) or "deferred to v1.1" in spec |
| `REJECTED-IN-BRAINSTORM` | Property proposed in brainstorm but rejected within the brainstorm process itself (agent dissent adopted); not a spec responsibility |

**Primary signal:** `DROPPED — UNSTATED` and `MODIFIED — UNSTATED` entries are the actionable findings — silent losses that have no breadcrumb for a future spec author or implementer.

| Spring-physics overshoot on popover entry (`cubic-bezier(0.34,1.56,0.64,1)`) | agent-1 idea 6 | `DEFERRED-INTENTIONAL` | `motion.md:95` | "Deferred to v1.1" |
| Skeleton shimmer (Idea 2 of agent-1) | agent-1 idea 2; `sky-atlas-v3` reference | `DROPPED — DOCUMENTED` | `motion.md:91` | "Cargo-cult; against iOS-restraint posture" |
| Body background radial-gradient (ellipse at 25% 30%, sunrise + daylight blue layers) | v4 map-area `sky-atlas-v4.html:251-264`; also v3 `sky-atlas-v3.html:325-340` | `DROPPED — UNSTATED` | none | Spec defines only flat `--color-bg-page` at `tokens.md:48`; no "atmospheric chrome" layer in any spec file; no documented rationale for drop. **Action:** either add `--atmosphere-overlay-light/dark` token + architecture note, or document the rejection explicitly |
| `--accent-secondary: #1d3b5b` (deep sky) and `--accent-cool: #4a7ba8` (daylight blue) from system poster | system-poster `sky-atlas-system.html:17-18` | `DROPPED — UNSTATED` | none | System poster had 3 accents; v4 collapsed to 1 (subtractive discipline at `voice-and-content.md:104-108`), but the compression is undocumented. A future designer reading only the spec cannot know 3 accents were considered and rejected |
| Cluster pill `::before` colored dot prefix (dot inside the pill) | v3 cluster idiom `sky-atlas-v3.html:373-381`; adopted in v4 visually | `DROPPED — UNSTATED` | none | `components.md:115-126` ClusterPill API has `count` + `onClick` only; dot prefix absent; no documented rationale |
| Photo attribution overlay scrim color (`rgba(0,0,0,0.55)`) | agent-2 idea 6 | `DROPPED — UNSTATED` | none | `<Photo>` API has `attribution: {text, href}` at `components.md:51,63` but no scrim token; scrim color is a free implementation choice |
| Italic scientific-name typography | v3 popover `sky-atlas-v3.html:316`; v3 detail `sky-atlas-v3.html:531`; v3 sheet `sky-atlas-v3.html:752`; v4 popover; system-poster | `DROPPED — UNSTATED` | none | Every mock renders sci-names in italic; spec is silent on typography family/style for sci-names; `voice-and-content.md` covers voice register but not type style |
| Inline-measured contrast comments extended to canvas paint expressions | agent-3 idea 1 closing | `MODIFIED — UNSTATED` | `accessibility.md:33-39` | Partial capture — extension enumerated but no CI enforcement added (unlike the lint guard at `tokens.md:114-122`); delta between "enumerated" and "enforced" is undocumented |
| `<Photo>` masthead overlay treatment (gradient + white species-name text + credit position) | agent-4 idea 6; v3 detail `sky-atlas-v3.html:496-528` (`linear-gradient(180deg, transparent 0%, transparent 50%, rgba(0,0,0,0.7) 100%)`) | `MODIFIED — UNSTATED` | `components.md:54` | Spec captures `layout: 'masthead'` prop but not the overlay's visual contract; gradient, text color, credit position are left to implementation; explains V-2 detail-surface drift in 4-agent audit |
| Detail surface as full-bleed at desktop (not modal-width dialog) | v3/v4 detail-desktop mockup `sky-atlas-v3.html:486-558` | `MODIFIED — UNSTATED` | `architecture.md:41`; `accessibility.md:20-23` | Spec says native `<dialog>` modal; mockups show full-viewport treatment; spec does not address dialog width at desktop; this implicitly downgraded full-bleed to modal-width without documentation |
| Family-color × basemap 32-cell audit matrix (8 families × 2 modes × 2 basemaps) | agent-2 idea 3 closing | `MODIFIED — DOCUMENTED` | `open-questions.md:75-80,83-88` | G7 captures light version; dark mode rolled into G8; only worst-case zoom check specified — per-family/per-mode/per-basemap matrix is not contracted, but the partial scope is explicit |
| Brand mark (26px diamond-in-square) | `sky-atlas-v3` mock; system-poster | `REJECTED-IN-BRAINSTORM` | `architecture.md:31` | Agent-5 counter 7 adopted in v4 ("no brand mark") |
| Dense-data / "Data Atlas" tabular direction | agent-5 counter 6 | `REJECTED-IN-BRAINSTORM` | `voice-and-content.md`; `open-questions.md:22-28` | G1 closed → Position B |
| Field Notebook humanist-serif direction | agent-5 closing | `REJECTED-IN-BRAINSTORM` | `architecture.md:96`; `tokens.md:157` | Position B + system stack adopted |

## Summary Counts

| Disposition | Count |
|---|---|
| `CAPTURED` | 51 |
| `DEFERRED-INTENTIONAL` | 9 |
| `DROPPED — DOCUMENTED` | 1 |
| `DROPPED — UNSTATED` | 5 |
| `MODIFIED — DOCUMENTED` | 1 |
| `MODIFIED — UNSTATED` | 3 |
| `REJECTED-IN-BRAINSTORM` | 3 |
| **Total** | **73** |

> One row from the seed matrix (`pushState` on detail-surface entry) was sourced from the phase-4 analysis report rather than a committed brainstorm artifact. It is included as `CAPTURED` because its spec citation exists and removing it would create a gap in the record. The scope bound does not exclude it.

**Actionable findings (requires spec update or documented rationale):**

1. Body radial-gradient — `DROPPED — UNSTATED` — no atmospheric background treatment in spec; either add token or document rejection
2. `--accent-secondary` + `--accent-cool` compression — `DROPPED — UNSTATED` — subtractive rationale exists in `voice-and-content.md:104-108` but is not explicitly stated as the reason for the 3→1 collapse
3. Cluster pill `::before` dot prefix — `DROPPED — UNSTATED` — dot is in both v3 and v4 mocks; absent from ClusterPill API with no note
4. Photo attribution scrim color — `DROPPED — UNSTATED` — scrim is a free implementation choice when it should be a token
5. Italic sci-name typography — `DROPPED — UNSTATED` — universal in mocks; absent from spec
6. Masthead overlay visual contract — `MODIFIED — UNSTATED` — `layout: 'masthead'` without gradient/color contract leaves Phase 4 free-fill
7. Detail surface desktop width — `MODIFIED — UNSTATED` — `<dialog>` modal choice implicitly downgraded full-bleed; undocumented
8. Canvas contrast enforcement gap — `MODIFIED — UNSTATED` — convention documented but not enforced (unlike CSS lint guard)

## Maintenance Protocol

**When to update this matrix:**

1. **Per redesign.** When a new major redesign brainstorm is completed, create a new versioned matrix (`coverage-matrix-v5.md`, etc.). Do not mutate this file to cover a different design generation. Each file covers exactly the brainstorm artifacts committed for that version. The `-v4` suffix refers to the v4 mock generation (`sky-atlas-v4.html`), not a document version number.

2. **When a new `DROPPED — UNSTATED` or `MODIFIED — UNSTATED` finding is identified in a future audit.** Add the row to this file, set disposition, and leave the "Captured-in" column blank. Do not wait for the next redesign cycle. The matrix is the permanent record of what was named in the brainstorm and what happened to it.

3. **When a spec is updated to address an UNSTATED finding.** Change the disposition from `DROPPED — UNSTATED` to `CAPTURED` (or `DROPPED — DOCUMENTED` if the decision is to formally drop it), add the spec citation, and add a note recording when the update happened.

**What does not trigger an update:**
- Implementation changes that do not touch spec files
- Token additions that were not in any brainstorm artifact (out of scope per the false-precision guard)
- Test file changes, build config changes
