/**
 * In-state on-map scope control (Task C4, #737).
 *
 * The FLOATING re-scope bar — rendered ONLY after a scope is chosen, i.e. in a
 * `?state=US-XX` state view or a `?scope=us` whole-US view. It is NEVER the
 * pre-map landing chooser (that is `<ScopeChooser>`, #742). It floats over the
 * map canvas (absolutely positioned overlay anchored top, above the basemap via
 * the `--z-overlay` tier the other map-assist overlays use) and lets a user
 * re-scope without going back to the chooser:
 *   - a native `<select>` StateSelector (no combobox lib — repo pattern),
 *   - the existing `<ZipInput>` (#739), reused not re-implemented,
 *   - a small, DE-EMPHASIZED exit affordance ("Change scope" → chooser) and,
 *     in a state view, a niche "Whole US" escape hatch (→ `?scope=us`).
 *
 * Ownership boundary (contract note, #737): ScopeControl is PURELY
 * PRESENTATIONAL. It does NOT own scope state, does NOT read/write the URL, and
 * — critically — NEVER touches the map. In particular it does NOT call
 * `map.setMaxBounds()`: per the C0 prototype's finding (a) + the C1 maplibre-5.x
 * notes §1, `maxBounds` is a REACTIVE camera prop owned by #736/C3. ScopeControl
 * only EMITS the new state code via `onPickState`; the parent (#740/C6) turns
 * that into URL writes + a `bounds`/`maxBounds` prop change, which flows to the
 * `<Map>` WITHOUT A REMOUNT. That no-remount-on-state-switch behaviour is the
 * whole point of this in-state control (prototype finding (a)).
 *
 * It also triggers NO data fetch: #740/C6 owns the "one refetch per scope
 * change" invariant (finding (d)). ScopeControl just emits one clean intent per
 * user action (`onPickState` / `onResolve` / `onPickWholeUs` / `onExit`).
 *
 * Camera hand-off (AC 5): because this control FLOATS over the canvas, #736/C3's
 * `fitBounds` top-padding must be ASYMMETRIC — top padding ≈ this bar's height —
 * so the framed state isn't occluded by the control. Flagged in the PR.
