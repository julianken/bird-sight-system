/**
 * Adaptive-grid reconciler memoization (epic #539 spec §5.3).
 *
 * Three separable caching concerns are addressed by three layers:
 *
 *   - Concern A (render-pass identity): `useMemo` at the parent (handled in
 *     the JSX render path below) keyed on [zoom, cluster_id, point_count,
 *     silhouettesVersion]. Defeated if `tiles` is a fresh array every render.
 *
 *   - Concern B (async-call avoidance): the module-scoped `leafCache` below
 *     stores Promises for `getClusterLeaves` calls so successive idle ticks
 *     don't re-query the same cluster. Key format: `${zoom}:${cluster_id}:
 *     ${point_count}`. The zoom prefix is load-bearing — supercluster's
 *     integer `cluster_id` values can collide across zoom levels.
 *
 *     Rejected-Promise eviction: `.catch()` cleanup at insert time deletes
 *     the entry in the same microtask, so a transient supercluster failure
 *     does not poison the cache for the cluster's lifetime. The rejection
 *     logs once via `warnedRejections` so a persistently-broken cluster
 *     doesn't spam the console on every idle.
 *
 *   - Concern C (catalogue rebuild invalidation): the module-scoped
 *     `cacheGeneration` counter is incremented + the cache is wholesale
 *     cleared when the silhouettes-deps effect re-registers. Each
 *     reconcile pass captures `myGen` at its top and no-ops the commit
 *     if the generation has advanced — closes the race where an in-flight
 *     reconcile from the prior catalogue commits stale tiles after a
 *     refresh.
 *
 * These caches survive component remount within a single test process; the
 * `__resetAdaptiveGridCacheForTesting()` export below is the test-only
 * escape hatch a `beforeEach` should call to avoid cross-test state leakage.

 *   maplibre-gl's Marker.addTo() calls `setAttribute('role', 'button')` on

 *   audit).
 *
 * Fix: react-map-gl's Marker component exposes the MapLibre MarkerInstance
 * via forwardRef. After mount we set role="presentation" on the wrapper
 * element. This overrides maplibre's role="button" and removes the
 * interactive semantics from the container; the child <button> remains the
 * canonical interactive element with full keyboard + AT support.

    //      the NEW state envelope ("Not a stale-maxBounds clamp" is true at this
    //      instant — react-map-gl DID apply the new bounds).
    //   2. But the still-in-flight `easeTo` from before the switch re-`apply`s a
    //      CLONE of its start transform (with the OLD state's `lngRange`) on its
    //      next animation frame — clobbering `lngRange` back to the OLD state
    //      BEFORE this passive effect even runs (passive effects fire after a
    //      paint, i.e. after ≥1 animation frame).
    //   3. So by the time this effect calls `fitBounds`, `transform.lngRange` is
    //      the OLD (e.g. western) state's. `fitBounds` → Mercator `handleEaseTo`
    //      captures its `from`-basis against that clobbered transform; with no
    //      `k===1` target snap (unlike flyTo) and `renderWorldCopies=false` (no
    //      world-copy wrap), the camera lands edge-pinned at the OLD state's
    //      eastern `lngRange` edge — the wrong, western-ish longitude.
    //
    // `cameraForBounds` returns the geometry-correct target even mid-flight (it
    // derives from absolute world geometry, independent of the live transform).
    // So we read the target up front and, on the settle `moveend` (after the
    // clobbering animation has fully ended so the clone no longer re-applies),
    // RE-ASSERT the new state's `maxBounds` (undoing the clone clobber of
    // `lngRange`) and `jumpTo` the target. This mirrors #762/#765's
    // imperative-reassert-on-moveend exactly, one axis over.
    //
    // Why the maxBounds reassert is REQUIRED (not just jumpTo): the clobbered
    // `lngRange` would clamp the corrective `jumpTo` straight back to the OLD
    // state's edge — verified live. The reassert is the ONE sanctioned imperative
    // `setMaxBounds` site (an idempotent reassert of the same declarative

   * Corrective `map.resize()` on the S2 flex→fixed container transition (#737,
   * gap 8 of #761). Before S2 the map was a `flex: 1; min-height: 0` child of a
   * padded `<main>`; S2 hoisted it into `#map-layer` (`position: fixed; inset: 0`)
   * and `.map-surface` became `position: absolute; inset: 0`. That swaps the
   * CONTAINING BLOCK (a reparent/reflow), and maplibre's built-in observer on the
   * inner GL container does not always re-read `_containerDimensions` for the new
   * full-viewport box on the first paint — leaving a one-frame mis-sized canvas
   * (clipped tiles, off-by-padding marker projection). S2 demonstrated the fallout
   * test-side: the coarse-pointer cluster-tap spec saw the marker DOM node
   * re-created ~600ms post-tap (`sameMarkerNode === false`) because the canvas was
   * still settling, and worked around it with an extra idle+rAF wait it deferred
   * to this PR.
   *
   * Fix: a `ResizeObserver` on the `data-testid="map-canvas"` wrapper (the box
   * whose containing block changed). It is the robust form because the box can
   * change AGAIN after the one-time reparent (theme-toggle reflow, the detail
   * rail/sheet opening alongside the fixed map, mobile URL-bar show/hide changing
   * 100vh). The observer is:
   *   - CAMERA-NEUTRAL: it only calls `map.resize()` — never `fitBounds`/`flyTo`/
   *     a refetch — so it cannot schedule a bbox `/api/observations` (the S4
   *     scope-gate invariant, report R1).
   *   - IDEMPOTENT / debounced: coalesced to the next animation frame so a burst
   *     of observer fires (including maplibre's own internal observer churn during
   *     the same reflow) collapses to a single `resize()`; a pending frame is
   *     guarded so we never stack rAFs.
   *   - DISCONNECTED on cleanup (observer + any pending rAF), so a `<Map>` remount
   *     across a scope pick leaks neither.
   * `mapReady`-gated so `getMap()` is live. The first observe-callback fire (which
   * ResizeObserver delivers on `observe()`) doubles as the one-shot post-`mapReady`
   * correction for the initial reparent.

  // explicit value), but it is not sufficient on the `state → us` transition.

  // react-map-gl set declaratively. The net live result was world copies stuck
  // OFF after leaving a state scope for `?scope=us` (PR #765 bot review,
  // reproduced live: `getRenderWorldCopies()` stayed `false`).

   * Adaptive-grid reconciler (epic #539). Queries rendered cluster features

   * §4.1). Clusters with uniqueFamilies > 16 OR point_count > 64 fall back

   * The reconciler enforces the three memoization layers (spec §5.3

   *   - Concern A: per-marker useMemo at JSX time.
   *   - Concern B: module-scoped `leafCache` (Promise cache, zoom-prefixed

   *   - Concern C: `cacheGeneration` race-safe commit + monotonic
   *     `silhouettesVersion` invalidation.

   * Bare-event handlers (no layer ID) — `idle` fires after every render
   * settle, NOT once per frame, so this is cheap. The async
